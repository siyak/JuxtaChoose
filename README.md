Can't decide what to buy? Ask your friends!

On one hand, what could be more fun than spending the day shopping with your best friends? You walk into a store and you suddenly see a gorgeous blouse that you must buy! Don’t we all know that feeling ;-)
Those moments are by far, few. And even then you have someone with you to give a timely advice.
Most of the times you are simply confused about which product is better.

On the other hand, e-retail has taken the market by storm. Everything is available just a click away. But let that not stop you from taking your friends’ valued advice! Just create a poll and invite your friends to vote.
