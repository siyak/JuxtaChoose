			<h4>Can't decide what to buy? Ask your friends!</h4>
			<br />
			<p>On one hand, what could be more fun than spending the day shopping with your best friends? You walk into a store and you suddenly see a gorgeous blouse that you must buy! Don’t we all know that feeling ;-)</p>
			<p>Those moments are by far, few. And even then you have someone with you to give a timely advice.</p>
			<p>Most of the times you are simply confused about which product is better.</p>
			<br />
			<p>On the other hand, e-retail has taken the market by storm. Everything is available just a click away. But let that not stop you from taking your friends’ valued advice! Just create a poll and invite your friends to vote.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Login with Facebook to create and share a poll or to vote on your friend's poll.</p>
			<br />
			<p>To create a poll,</p>
			<ul class="create-poll-instructions">
				<li>Click on Create Poll.</li>
				<li>Enter the product url in text field.<br />eg. http://www.snapdeal.com/product/guess-white-passion-watch/1247217</li>
				<li>Find!</li>
				<li>Add more than two options to create a poll.</li>
				<li>Don't forget to add a description.</li>
				<li>Create!</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p>Once the poll is created, share the url with your friends on Facebook.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Once your friends vote, hopefully it'll be easier decision for you!</p>
